Internal Resources
------------------

The Lab Group maintains and builds on an extensive collection of shared resources and codes. These are available to all Group members, and members are expected to help maintain and improve this resource base over time.

This shared resources repository is available through the Network Attached Storage (NAS) drive that lives in the Planetary Cartography Lab. A separate guide to set up an account and remote access is available.
