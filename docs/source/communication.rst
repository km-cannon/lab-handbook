Group meetings (Zoom):
    Notionally one hour in length, held every 2 weeks. Weâ€™ll use group meetings to keep up to date on projects, progress, and new directions. Expect to be called on, to give your honest opinion, and to provide feedback for other Group members.

One-on-one meetings (Zoom or in-person):
    Used for more in-depth progress updates, voicing concerns or issues, and working out detailed research problems. Expect to have material to show for recent progress.
