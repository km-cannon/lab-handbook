Hours
-----

The Lab operates on a flextime arrangement. For Grads and Postdocs, the number of hours you work, and especially which hours, are not nearly as important as progress and results. Having said that, Postdoc and residential Graduate Student positions are paid at full time and should be treated as a main occupation.

Working remotely (Postdoc/Grad Student)
---------------------------------------

Any combination of remote, hybrid, and in-person work arrangement is acceptable, except in the case of lab-based experiments when more in-person lab time will be needed.

Vacations (Postdoc/Grad Student):
---------------------------------

Vacation timing and duration are completely flexible, but keep track of the dates of major conferences to avoid conflicts (see: Conferences). Vacations do not need any kind of approval, but should be added to the appropriate Slack channel so everyone is informed.
