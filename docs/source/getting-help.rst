Getting Help
============
It’s always better to ask for help than to make assumptions, or to struggle in silence for extended periods.

Help with research
------------------

Make use of the other Group members first (in person or on Slack), and any other students and postdocs who might be around. If you can’t get help quickly, elevate issues to the PI during meetings. For quick questions or urgent issues, use other contact methods (e.g., phone/text).

For help outside the group, start with other faculty or researchers at Mines who may have the necessary expertise. Then, progress to outside experts. If you need an introduction, ask. Set up meetings or phone/Zoom calls as needed. If a cold email to someone is more than a couple paragraphs, it’s better to try and set up a call. The PI doesn’t need to be cc’ed on your emails unless necessary.

Help with personal issues
-------------------------

Inform the PI if it’s appropriate to do so. If the issue involves the PI, draw on other resources within the University as necessary.
