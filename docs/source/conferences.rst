Conference travel
-----------------

You should book your own travel arrangements as convenient. Be reasonable: you don’t need to stay on a bunk bed at a youth hostel, but you shouldn’t be in a private suite at the Ritz Carleton. Share rooms if you can, many conferences have message boards to find roommates if there’s an uneven number of lab mates attending. Lab members are entitled to have their own room if needed for personal reasons.
