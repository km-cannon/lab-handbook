Publications
============

Authorship
----------

Authorship denotes meaningful contributions to a paper. This usually either involves direct work and/or financial support. Direct work could involve: conception, experiment planning, data collection, data analysis, writing, creating figures.

Publication checklist
---------------------

1. Make sure the document is double-spaced with continuous line numbers throughout.
2. Read through the journalâ€™s publication guide and make sure all conventions on word count, formatting, and section types are followed (use templates found in Internal Resources).
3. Cross-check citations in-text against citations in the reference list (can use Excel)
4. If revising, add the reviewers to the acknowledgements.

Preprints
---------

Preprints are optional, but can be useful to stake claims for research that others may be working on at the same time. Both arXiv (more quantitative papers) and ESSOAr are appropriate.
