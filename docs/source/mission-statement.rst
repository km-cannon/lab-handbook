Mission Statement
=================

The overarching goal of the Lab is to carry out high-caliber research activities and technology development that enable humanity to expand into space as quickly as possible. The specific areas where we aim to focus our efforts include:

(1) Understanding the nature and evolution of planetary surfaces and materials.
(2) Characterizing the resources available in space, including their distributions, quantities, compositions, and physical properties.
(3) Developing and testing creative, smart technologies to prospect for, extract, beneficiate, and use these resources.
(4) Working with private companies and government to help enable their mission goals.

The Lab aims to draw on business and entrepreneurial practices to set itself apart from traditional academic lab groups. Specifically, this includes:

(1) Treating the Lab Group as a unified team, not a collection of individuals who happen to work for the same PI. To this end, we maintain extensive shared resources, work together on projects, and improve each other’s work through critical feedback. Publications can be featured in more than one student’s thesis.
(2) Framing research results and technology as our product, and the science community, government, and industry as our customer. We track our impact over time and take steps to improve efficiency and effectiveness.
(3) Using software tools to improve communication and workflow.

The Cannon group is quite new, founded in 2020.
