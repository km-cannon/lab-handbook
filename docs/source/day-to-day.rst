Work-life balance
-----------------

Lab members should strive to work hard, but maintain a positive work-life balance. To help promote this:

- Grad students and Postdocs are encouraged to take vacations, long weekends, and days off. The Lab policies on vacation time are purposefully lenient.

- All meetings can be attended by Zoom for Lab members who are working off campus.

- Snacks and tea/coffee are available in the Planetary Cartography Lab.

- Members are encouraged to take part in `Intramurals <https://minesathletics.com/sports/im>`_, make use of the `CSM Student Recreation Center <https://minesathletics.com/sports/src>`_, take advantage of the outdoors that Colorado has to offer.
