Code of Conduct
===============

Lab members are expected to follow the Code of Conduct while performing their duties.

Reporting Concerns
------------------
The Lab is committed to a culture of transparency, and one where members feel free to express concerns or to raise issues without hesitation or fear of retaliation. To foster this culture, all of us must report instances of improper conduct, unsafe conditions, conflicts of interest, violations of law or policy, or other irregularities.

Scientific Integrity
--------------------
Scientific excellence is a foundational element of our mission at CSM that depends upon objective, honest observation, analysis, and reporting. We must perform our work with integrity in accordance with the highest ethical and professional standards.

Objectivity
-----------
Lab members who are engaged in research are expected to maintain proper scientific objectivity. This means that we must recognize the responsibility common to engineers,
scientists, and other professionals of maintaining public confidence and peer credibility by seeking and stating the truth as we understand it.

Equal Opportunity
-----------------
The Lab provides employment and opportunities for advancement, compensation, training, and growth according to individual merit, without regard to race, color, religion, sex, national origin, sexual orientation, gender identity, marital status, veteran status, age, genetic information, or disability.

Safe Workplace
--------------
Safety is core to our operations. We are all responsible for working safely, protecting the safety and health of others, promptly reporting at-risk behaviors or conditions, and stopping work when observing imminent danger. Lab members should notify the PI, or the appropriate representative designated to oversee matters of safety or any issues or concerns regarding health, safety practices, and environmental issues. The PI is responsible for providing an environment where work can be performed safely and where environmental, safety and health concerns can be readily brought forward without fear of retaliation.

Compliance with law
-------------------
All members must protect CSM’s legality. They should comply with all environmental, safety and fair dealing laws. I expect members to be ethical and responsible when dealing with our group’s research output, partnerships and public image.

Respect in the workplace
------------------------
All members should respect their colleagues. I won't allow any kind of discriminatory behavior, harassment or victimization. Members should conform with the equal opportunity policy in all aspects of their work.

Protection of Company Property
------------------------------
All employees should treat our company's property, whether material or intangible, with respect and care.

Professionalism
---------------
All members must show integrity and professionalism in the workplace:

Conflict of interest
--------------------
I expect members to avoid any personal, financial or other interests that might hinder their capability or willingness to perform their job duties.

Collaboration
-------------
Members should be friendly and collaborative. They should try not to disrupt the workplace or present obstacles to their colleagues' work.

Communication
-------------
All members must be open for communication with their colleagues, the PI or other CSM faculty/staff.

Plagiarism
----------
Plagiarism is completely unacceptable. Keep in mind that all major journals run publications through plagiarism checkers, and in academia it’s often the people who get plagiarized that are the ones reviewing the papers and proposals of those who plagiarized them. Any violations will be treated seriously and reported as necessary to the University administration.
