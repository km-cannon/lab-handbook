Onboarding
==========

Hiring Paperwork
----------------

For Undergraduates, a representative from the MAPS office will reach out to you with the paperwork needed to get on payroll, and you will need to set up an appointment with MAPS to finalize everything. They will give you a slip of paper that you can pass onto me.

Once you’re on payroll, time sheets can be filled in through Trailhead by going to Self Service, and using the Employee tab at the top.

Graduate Students will also have to go through the MAPS office for onboarding paperwork, and for students on a TA or GRA, they will contact you about direct deposit.

BlasterCard
-----------

For those new to Mines, the BlasterCard office is located in the Ben H. Parker Student Center, room E140.

Hardware
--------

Postdocs and Grad Students will be provided access to a desktop or laptop on an as-needed basis, which may include the desktops in the Planetary Cartography Lab. There are also shared workstations in the Cartography Lab available for Undergrads.

Building/lab access
-------------------

Once you obtain your BlasterCard, I will request door access for you for the relevant labs and buildings. The Planetary Cartography Lab requires a hard key that I will arrange for you to pick up from the Lockshop.

Lab Safety Training
-------------------

All members working in a laboratory space (Space Resources Lab, EMI, etc.) must take the `General Laboratory Safety Training from EHS <https://www.mines.edu/ehs/training/>`_.

Members will also receive lab-specific training from the PI depending on the spaces they’ll be working in.

Postdocs must also enroll in the Safe Science training from EHS.
