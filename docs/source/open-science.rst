Open Science
============

Open Science
------------
We aim to publish all Lab Group publications as Open Access, and strive to make as much of the underlying data and code available when it’s reasonable to do so. For complex, limited-use codes, the lead author has discretion on making these available. Check with the PI if you have questions about what should and shouldn’t be made publicly available.

Personal Files
--------------
Each Lab member has their own folder on the group NAS drive. Treat these folders as semi-public, and do not store personal or private data on them that you don’t want others having access to.

Shared Code
-----------
The Group maintains a `GitHub repository of shared code <https://github.com/planetary-cartography-lab>`_. Group members are free to use, modify, and improve this code base.

Members are encouraged, but not required to add new codes they generate to the shared code repository.

Private codes from the shared repository should not be sent to others outside the Group without permission from the PI. When leaving the Group (see: Offboarding), you should have a conversation with the PI about what codes (other than those you developed) you can take with you.
